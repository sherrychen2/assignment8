## Description

My website aims to showcase my work as a UX Designer. As someone applying to jobs in the field, a website with my work and case studies will best show my skills. I convey information about myself on my website. I also showcase my work through links. My website is engaging due to its simplicity. I think my website is engaging with only two columns, displaying my information in a jQuery accordion and my work in each column. My target audience is anyone interested in UX Design or my work. However, I designed it with minimalistic ideals because if a recruiter used my website to learn more about me as a candidate, I would want them to have quick access to everything they need.

## External Libaries

  ### jQuery
  - I chose jQuery because I saw many examples utilizing this tool. jQuery is a powerful library as it adds event handling, animation, and HTML DOM traversal. I knew I wanted to include a lot of information on my website so I use jQuery to create an accordion. My accordion is simple, it has 4 categories. This helped condense my information and group it into categories. It adds a sense of organization and minimalism. 

## Iteration From HW7

I iterated from my HW7 mockup because I changed my website to a personal portfolio. I realized it would be smarter to create a personal portfolio rather than a informational website because recruiting season will be coming up towards the end of summer. I redesigned everything from the pages to the interactions. 

## Major Challenges

There were some major challenges I experienced when implementing my website. I couldn't figure out why my accordion was not opening and closing so I read comments from stackoverflow.com that helped me solve the issue. I also had trouble implementing the New York City page. My images were not moving around but after watching a YouTube video I managed to solve the problem.
